# auto_backup #

This is a fork from https://github.com/Yenthe666/auto_backup.

(And still heavily in development)

Changes:
- You can now only backup the database you are in (this didn't make much sense to me)
- You now have to choice between "local", "SFTP" and "Windows share"
- module is refactored to add as many remote storage systems you want

Feel free to use it or suggest some changes.
